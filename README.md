# ValorantMusicController
A small app that monitors whether you are alive or dead in Valorant and adapts the volume of your game and music accordingly.

# Setup :
- Start the program a first time in order for it to create the var.txt file
- Start the program a second time and use the pixel selector to tell the program which pixels to monitor using F9 :

Once the pixels are set up, I advise you create a copy of the var.txt file as a backup.

If there is a modification in coordinates using the script, the program will keep a backup of the last version of the file just in case, but if there are multiple modifications, the data will be lost.

# Additional Setup (facultative)
In the var.txt file created by the program, you can adjust the pixel locations, default music app, and default volume levels.
